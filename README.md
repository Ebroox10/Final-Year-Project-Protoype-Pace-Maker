# Final-Year-Project-Protoype-Pace-Maker
This Project was carried out during my final year of my studies at Staffordshire University. 
The project was designed due to there being a lack of security around implantable devices. 
Within this project I have attached the Dissertation that this project was created for as well 
as a research paper that discusses the worries around the security of these devices.
